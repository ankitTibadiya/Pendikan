CS546 Final Project

On-campus tutoring system for students to help fellow students. Students who
received an A and above in a subject can help current students enrolled in that subject. The
idea is to provide a platform between a student in need and a tutor. A student issues a
“Request” which can be viewed by the tutors. Tutors willing to accept the request will respond
with an “Accept”.
